Put your answers in this file and submit it under the T-Square assignment.


Problem 1
---------
A) The BILL 9000 computer has 16 address wires and has a 8 bit word size.

The addressability of this memory is...

8-bit.

The address space of this memory is...

65536 byte.

B) The NOOB 2110 computer (also sold as the ANDREW 2110 computer in some markets)
has 7 address wires and has a 8 bit word size.However memory addresses 0x00 - 0x1F
are not able to be written to or read from.

The addressability of this memory is...

8-bit

The address space of this memory is...

96 byte.

(Some things to think about)
- What is the addressability of your laptop computer?
- What is the address space of your laptop computer?


Problem 2
---------

What is the difference between combinational and sequential logic?

Sequential logic compute the output based on the input and the state which is
updated based on a clock.


Complete the following table by marking an "x" where applicable.

|========================================|
| Component | Combinational | Sequential |
|========================================|
| ALU       |       X       |            |
| AND GATE  |       X       |            |
| REGISTER  |               |      X     |
| MEMORY    |               |      X     |
| DECODER   |       X       |            |
| RS LATCH  |       X       |            |
=========================================|


Problem 3
---------
Make a 2-bit addressable memory that has a address space of 8. (i.e. there are 8 addresses each holding 2 bits)
You do not need to turn this circuit in, but it is highly recommend that you actually make it.


How many bits are there for the output of your memory?

2

How many bits are there for the address input of the memory?

3


Make sure to ask the TA's if you have any questions!
